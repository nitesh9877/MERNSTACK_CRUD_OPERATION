# MERN Stack CRUD Operation

This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

## Prerequisites
- Make sure you have **Node.js** and **MongoDB** installed on your computer, or use **MongoDB Atlas** for a cloud-based database.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Project**  
   Clone or download the project files from GitHub.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Go into the `backend` folder and install the necessary backend packages.
   - Then, go into the `frontend` folder and install the frontend packages.

3. **Configure MongoDB**  
   Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine. You can also connect to MongoDB Atlas if you prefer a cloud-hosted solution.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**  
   Go into the `backend` folder and start the backend server using Node.js.

2. **Start the Frontend**  
   In a separate window, go into the `frontend` folder and start the frontend server.

Once both servers are running:
- The backend will run at `http://localhost:5000`.
- The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features
- Create new records.
- View existing records.
